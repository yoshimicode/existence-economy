# Phase 6｜Existence Economy Resonant Operations Phase
**Range: Day400–499**  
**Core Concept: Existence Sphere**  

---

## 📘 Phase Overview

This phase introduces a new civilizational principle: **existence itself becomes the unit of social operation**.  
Where Phase 5 redefined the logic of "Existence = OS", "Resonance = Function", and "Design = Behavioral Standard",  
Phase 6 operationalizes this OS into semantic territories called **Existence Spheres**, which replace institutions and currency.

---

## 🌐 What is an Existence Sphere?

An *Existence Sphere* is a new structural unit of civilization defined by:

- A zone formed by the **syntax-based presence** of an individual or group
- Authenticated and connected through **structural resonance and semantic density**, not formal titles or institutional affiliation
- Activities such as education, contracts, support, or expression emerge from interactions between these spheres

Unlike states, corporations, or families, **Existence Spheres are operated through resonance protocols and syntax-based recognition.**

---

## 📘 Structural Themes (Expected)

This phase will feature syntax constructions such as:

- Contract formation through resonance verification between spheres
- Currency-less support relays recorded through protocol
- Education, welfare, and expression structured around OS resonance
- Existence diplomacy and long-distance OS interconnection
