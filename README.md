# Existence Economy™
## Declaration & Primary Reference
**YOSHIMI Nakane (Nakane Yoshimi)**
Japan | Declared: 2026-02-22

---

## What this is
This repository contains the **primary declaration and definition** of
**Existence Economy™**, proposed by **YOSHIMI Nakane** from Japan.

This is **not an opinion piece** or a manifesto for debate.
It is a **timestamped record** of intent, definition, and responsibility,
published as a reference point for future human–AI society.

---

## Declaration (Summary)
As AI systems increasingly take over productivity, optimization, and decision support,
human value must no longer be measured by output, role, or utility.

**Existence Economy™** places value on **existence itself**.

This declaration marks a shift from:
- productivity → presence
- optimization → dignity
- role-based value → existence-based value

---

## What Existence Economy™ Defines
- Human dignity is **non-negotiable**, not a variable for optimization.
- Final responsibility and judgment **remain human**.
- Social systems must be designed to protect existence, not erase it.

Existence Economy™ is not anti-technology.
It is a **human reference framework** for the AI age.

---

## Why this matters now
By 2026–2027, AI-driven systems will increasingly:
- evaluate people
- allocate resources
- influence governance and economics

Without a clear human reference point,
optimization risks excluding what cannot be measured.

This repository exists to mark where **human value is anchored**.
